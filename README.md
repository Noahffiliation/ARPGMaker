# ARPGMaker
ARPGMaker is a Python module that provides functionality for creating 2D action games using a custom C++ engine with subsystems, including audio and tile mapping.

## Requirements
- [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and `python3.7-dev`
- [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5)
- `python3-distutils`
```
sudo apt-get install python3-distutils
```

## Build and Run
Build the ARPGMaker module:
```
$ make build
```
Clear the ARPGMaker module
```
$ make clean
```
